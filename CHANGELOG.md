## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Disabling hiding the ShapesGE window, as the window cannot be shown again.

### Changed
- Text class renamed to TextBlock (english API) and BlokTextu (slovak API) to 
  differentiate names between localizations
- FontStyle enum renamed to StylFontu in the slovak API
- ExitOnClose configuration option replaced by OnClose = hide/exit/nothing/send message.

### Fixed
- key events with key modifiers are parsed correctly
